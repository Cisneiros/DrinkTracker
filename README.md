# DrinkTrackker

This is a simple project I created just so I can learn WatckKit basics. It's a simple app to track how much you drink. Its iOS counterpart is not implemented, and lacks quite a lot of stuff, as I was focusing on learning watchOS programming.

This app was presented at the CocoaHeads Recife Meetup, on May 2016.
